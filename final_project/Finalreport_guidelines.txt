Hints
Data sources
Your data has to be accessible at all times (i.e. open source). Here is a non-exhaustive list of sources you can download data from:
CERN
European Data Portal
Swiss Open Data
UN Data
⚫ World Bank Data
Google Dataset Search
Github Awesome Public Datasets
• Open Data Inception
• Corgis
⚫ Data is Plural: Google Sheet with 1000+ datasets
The dataset you choose should be large enough to allow for extreme values analysis (at least 1000 data measures). Report
On the first page of the report, do not forget to write down your names, your student numbers, your group number and the date. Number your plots and the pages of your report.
You are advised to use R Markdown. In any case provide the code.
Presentation
Everyone in the group should participate in the presentation.
