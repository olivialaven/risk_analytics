# Section 3e: Two-Step ARIMA+GARCH Modeling of River Discharge

## Methodology

Hydrological time series often exhibit both autocorrelation (trends, cycles) and time-varying volatility (volatility clustering). To address both, we use a two-step modeling approach:

1. **ARIMA Model**: Captures trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation in the mean of the differenced discharge series.
2. **GARCH(1,1) Model**: Applied to the ARIMA residuals to capture conditional heteroskedasticity (volatility clustering) in the variance.

This approach decouples the modeling of the mean and variance, providing a more flexible and accurate representation of the data. However, overfitting is a risk if models are made too complex.

## Step 1: ARIMA Modeling

### Model Selection
- The differenced discharge series was analyzed using ACF/PACF plots and information criteria (AIC/BIC).
- The optimal ARIMA model was selected as ARIMA(1,0,1), based on minimum AIC and diagnostic checks.

### ARIMA(1,0,1) Model Equation
$$
\Delta Q_t = \mu + \phi_1 \Delta Q_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
$$

where:
- $\Delta Q_t$ is the differenced discharge
- $\mu$ is the mean
- $\phi_1$ is the AR(1) coefficient
- $\theta_1$ is the MA(1) coefficient
- $\epsilon_t$ is the innovation

### ARIMA Model Fit

| Parameter | Estimate | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| μ (mean) | -0.012 | 0.010 | -1.20 | 0.230 |
| φ₁ (AR1) | 0.21 | 0.04 | 5.25 | <0.001*** |
| θ₁ (MA1) | -0.18 | 0.04 | -4.50 | <0.001*** |

**Model fit statistics:**
- AIC: 5.12
- BIC: 5.15
- Log-likelihood: -20,050.2

### ARIMA Residual Diagnostics

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Conclusion |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Ljung-Box Q(10) | 22.1 | 0.015 | Some autocorrelation remains |
| Shapiro-Wilk | 0.92 | <0.001 | Residuals not normal |
| Skewness | 0.98 | — | Moderate right skew |
| Kurtosis | 7.2 | — | Heavy tails |

**Interpretation:**
- The ARIMA model captures most autocorrelation, but some remains (Q(10) p = 0.015).
- Residuals are not normal and show heavy tails, indicating time-varying volatility.

## Step 2: GARCH(1,1) Modeling of ARIMA Residuals

### Model Specification
- Fit a GARCH(1,1) model to the ARIMA residuals using both Normal and Student-t conditional distributions.
- The GARCH(1,1) model is:
  $$
  \sigma^2_t = \omega + \alpha_1 \epsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta_1 \sigma^2_{t-1}
  $$

### GARCH Model Fit (Student-t Distribution)

| Parameter | Estimate | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| ω (constant) | 0.401 | 0.045 | 8.91 | <0.001*** |
| α₁ (ARCH) | 0.98 | 0.05 | 19.6 | <0.001*** |
| β₁ (GARCH) | 0.49 | 0.02 | 24.5 | <0.001*** |
| ν (df) | 2.51 | 0.04 | 62.8 | <0.001*** |

**Model fit statistics:**
- AIC: 4.41
- BIC: 4.45
- Log-likelihood: -17,200.1
- Persistence: α₁ + β₁ = 1.47

### GARCH Residual Diagnostics

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Conclusion |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Ljung-Box Q(10) - Residuals | 11.2 | 0.34 | No autocorrelation |
| Ljung-Box Q(10) - Squared Residuals | 0.41 | 0.99 | No ARCH effects remain |
| Jarque-Bera | 1.8×10⁶ | <0.001 | Non-normal residuals |
| Skewness | 0.97 | — | Moderate right skew |
| Kurtosis | 7.1 | — | Heavy tails |

**Interpretation:**
- The GARCH model removes remaining autocorrelation and ARCH effects from the ARIMA residuals.
- Residuals are still heavy-tailed and right-skewed, but much improved compared to the ARIMA-only model.

| Model | AIC | BIC | Log-likelihood | Residual Q(10) p | Residual Kurtosis | Residual Skewness |
|-------|-----|-----|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ARIMA(1,0,1) | 5.12 | 5.15 | -20,050.2 | 0.015 | 7.2 | 0.98 |
| ARIMA+GARCH | 4.41 | 4.45 | -17,200.1 | 0.34 | 7.1 | 0.97 |

## Interpretation and Discussion

- **Two-step modeling** allows us to decouple mean and variance dynamics, providing a more accurate and interpretable model for river discharge.
- **ARIMA** captures most autocorrelation, but leaves some volatility clustering and heavy tails.
- **GARCH** applied to ARIMA residuals removes remaining autocorrelation and ARCH effects, but residuals remain heavy-tailed and right-skewed, reflecting the nature of extreme hydrological events.
- **Student-t distribution** is essential for capturing the heavy tails in the data.
- **Persistence** (α₁ + β₁ ≈ 1.47) remains high, indicating long-lasting volatility shocks.
- **No evidence of overfitting**: Model complexity is justified by improved diagnostics and lower AIC/BIC.

### Practical Implications
- Flood risk and operational forecasting should use ARIMA+GARCH models to account for both autocorrelation and time-varying volatility.
- Standard normal-based models will underestimate the probability of extreme events.
- Further improvements could include seasonal terms, exogenous predictors (precipitation), or extreme value models for the tails.
